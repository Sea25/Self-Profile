            <h2>Pass With Ease</h2>
            <p>Our project, <strong>Pass With Ease</strong>,a student-friendly web platform designed to simplify buying, selling, and exchanging books while promoting learning. It features dynamic book listings with search functionality, allowing users to upload books for exchange or sale, including editable prices for sellers. The tutoring section offers educational videos in a responsive grid layout, and a contact section includes a form and an embedded Google Map for location details. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform boasts a clean, modern design with interactive elements like hover effects and modals. Future enhancements could include backend integration, user authentication, and payment gateways, making it a one-stop solution for affordable learning resources and book sharing.</p>
