                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a first-year B.Tech IT student with a strong passion for technology. I have learned Python, C, and C++, and I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by participating in a hackathon. Recently, I took part in Keralaâ€™s largest hackathon, TinkHer Hack, where my team and I developed a project aimed at making academic resource sharing more accessible for students. Our efforts led to a successful project submission, earning me a certificate of achievement. Excited to grow in the tech field, I am eager to join Women in Tech at SAIT and engaging with a community of innovative and driven individuals.</p>
